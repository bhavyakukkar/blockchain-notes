- A __byzantine fault__ is a condition of a distributed computing system, where a fault occurs such that different symptoms are presented to different observers, including imperfect information on whether a system component has failed
- __BFT__ or __Byzantine Fault Tolerance__ is the resilience of a system to avoid Byzantine Faults by arriving at a concensus among nodes across an unrealiable channel

- Distributed (decentralized) and immutable (not modifiable) chain of blocks of signed transactions where each block is validated by special nodes that validate each transaction in the block against overspending and add their proof-of-work such that blocks can be trusted
- Any implementation of Blockchain is a protocol that every client must agree on (since the blockchain is decentralized) and one that solves in any capacity the [[BFT|Byzantine Generals' Problem]]
- Application layer protocol

## Consensus
- Consensus is a vital part of blockchains, as blockchains are nothing but a distributed state, and consensus among the nodes in a blockchain network determines the serial state of the blockchain
- The [[Ethereum]] blockchain considers the agreement among at least 66% of the network to count as consensus

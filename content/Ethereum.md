- Ethereum came about as a way to generalize the nature in which the blockchain may be used, by conducting for the entries on the blockchain to be **"transaction-based state machine"**
- `Ether (ETH)` is the cryptocurrency used for many things on the Ethereum network
- The main or base ethereum blockchain is referred to as the `mainnet` chain or `Layer 1`

# Proof of Stake
- In 2022, Ethereum successfully switched from a [[Bitcoin|proof-of-work]] to an alternative consensus model called `proof-of-stake`
- `TODO`
- Since changes to the chain specification require a coordinted fork, the chain with the new proof-of-stake consensus model was called the `beacon-chain`
- `The Merge` was the event when the beacon chain finally merged with the then main `mainnet` chain
- Proof-of-stake uses `ether` to validate and propose blocks on the mainnet

# Accounts
- An Ethereum account is an entity with an ether (ETH) balance that can send transactions on Ethereum
- There are 2 types of Ethereum accounts:


## EOA
- Externally-owned accounts are controlled by anyone with their ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) private key


## Contract Accounts
- An Ethereum account, aside from identifying a participating node in the Ethereum network, can also be a contract account, taking the place of a single invokable contract on the Ethereum network
- Transactions made to a contract-account expect the name of the called function and its input parameters in the `data` field of the transaction so that the contract may be invoked


## Account Abstraction
Before the abstract of an `account` introduced in [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337), the authorization process included checking only the following:
1. Account's key pair (elliptive-curve cryptography or ECDSA)
2. Account's nonce (Number-once)
3. Account's balance (prevention of overspending)

However, the `account` abstraction was introduced, without any changes to the consensus protocol, to allow "pseudo-transactions" called `UserOperations` that end up being executed from a separate mempool into packages called `bundle transactions` by a special class of actors called `bundlers` after they make a call to the `EntryPoint` contract.



# Smart Contracts
- A stateful program that can be the recipient to decentralized transactions, where the parameters and results of the invoked program then get recorded into the blockchain
- [Example of sample Ethereum Smart-contract account](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48)



# EVM
[[ETH/Evm]]



# State
- The state of the Ethereum blockchain is its composition, consisting of all ether transactions (from an EOA to another EOA or a smart-contract) and all contract invocations, welded into a single series of blocks through consensus among the nodes in the Ethereum network
- The state of the ethereum blockchain is encoded into a [[ETH/Merkle-Patricia Trie]], which itself is a modified version of the [[Bitcoin|Merkle Tree]]
- There is a [roadmap](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/verkle-trees/) to move to a [[ETH/Verkle Tree]] structure so that Ethereum can support `stateless clients` (clients that can participate in the Ethereum networks without needing to store any history of the ethereum state)



# Layer 2
The main ethereum blockchain (called the `mainnet`) can only handle ~15 transactions per second, in order to increase scalability, layer 2 solutions are required, where "layer 2" or L2 describes any solution implemented on a separate chain than the mainnet.
- Generally speaking, transactions are submitted to these layer 2 nodes instead of being submitted directly to layer 1
- [Layer 2 Scaling](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/#layer-2-scaling)
- [More on layer 2](https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/)


## Rollups
- Rollups are the most obvious L2 scaling solution to offload some traffic from L1 by bundling a certain amount of transactions off-chain (not on the mainnet), and finally uploading them as a single L1 transaction instead and thus reducing network traffic as well as gas fees
- Rollups have been criticized to decrease the decentralization factor since they are often hosted by a centralized server or a clusters of servers, though they might also be hosted by individual nodes much like L1

- [Addressing common rollup misconceptions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/pmvbbh/addressing_common_rollup_misconceptions/)


### Optimistic Rollups
- Optimistic rollups, when sending the bundled transactions, assume that all the transactions are valid and accurate unless disputed via `fraud proofs`
- **Fraud Proof:** A full node, upon seeing an invalid state transition being gossiped around the network, could quickly generate a small piece of data demonstrating that a proposed state transition could not possibly arise from a given set of transactions and broadcast that data to peers
- Popular Optimistic Rollups include [Arbitrum](https://docs.arbitrum.io/intro/glossary#arbitrum-rollup-protocol), [Base](https://docs.base.org/docs/terms-of-service/#1-base-and-bridging-smart-contracts) & [Optimism](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/rollup)

### Zero-Knowledge Rollups
- Tying back into the concept of [[ZKP/Zero Knowledge Proofs]], these are rollups that use ZKPs to attach a proof of the consensus to the rollups which the target L1 branch can verify
- Rollups consist of `Prover` nodes that generate proofs about the input transactions and the resultant change in the state, whereby a smart-contract on the beacon chain can act as a verifier to verify the proof and add the sum transaction upon successful verification

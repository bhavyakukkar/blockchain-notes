- A _**Z**ero-**k**nowledge **V**irtual **M**achine_ is a virtual-machine that, besides executing programs, also produces a [[ZKP/Zero Knowledge Proofs|zero-knowledge proof]] of their execution. It is a more general form of a **zkEVM** which only executes and proves the execution of Ethereum transactions and contracts on its state trie.

- **sp1** is a **zkVM** that can prove the execution of programs in the `RISC-V` instruction-set. It also provides a library and toolchain to ease the creation of programs from programs written in Rust
- Uses a custom toolchain to compile programs (whose execution will be proven) written in Rust to `RISC-V` instructions, which can then be executed in the sp1 zkVM to generate a proof of their execution

| **Si** | **Stage**                       | **Description** |
| ------ | ------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 1.     | **Compile Program**             | Write a Rust program that uses the [`sp1-zkvm`](https://docs.rs/sp1-zkvm/latest/sp1_zkvm/) library to compile the program, while using [utilities](https://docs.rs/sp1-zkvm/latest/sp1_zkvm/#modules) provided by the library to interact with the virtual-machine including I/O, heap-allocations & system-calls. This step may be done in other language that can compile to `RISC-V` (which includes all languages that have an LLVM backend), but then the `sp1-zkvm` library may not be used and linking would have to be done manually. [Sample Rust program that will get compiled to RISC-V](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1-project-template/blob/main/program/src/main.rs) |
| 2.     | **Generate Proof of Execution** | Invoke the virtual-machine using [`sp1-sdk`](https://docs.rs/sp1-sdk/latest/sp1_sdk/) to execute the compiled program, which produces its output and a proof of its execution. Before execution, the proving and verifying keys are generated from the program. [Sample Rust program that creates the prover-client, makes it generate the proof and then verifies the same proof](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1-project-template/blob/main/script/src/bin/main.rs) |
| 3.     | **Verify Proof of Execution**   | Verify the execution of the program using its provided proof and verifying key (the inputs provided to the program are not needed for verification) |

# Mempools
The pool of transactions that are waiting to be included in a block by one of the special or validator nodes. Since the blockchain is decentralized, a mempool resides on every single node's machine with varying specifications (size of the pool, etc.)

# Gossip protocols in ethereum

# How does consensus among nodes happen

# Once a node executes the transaction, how does it get added to the main chain?

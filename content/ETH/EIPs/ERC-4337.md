Before the abstract of an __account__ introduced in [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337), the authorization process included checking only the following:
1. Account's key pair (elliptive-curve cryptography or ECDSA)
2. Account's nonce (Number-once)
3. Account's balance (prevention of overspending)


However, __account__ abstraction was introduced, without any changes to the consensus protocol, to allow "pseudo-transactions" called `UserOperation`s that end up being executed from a separate mempool into packages called __bundle transactions__ by a special class of actors called __bundlers__ after they make a call to the `handleOps` function of the special `EntryPoint` contract. Since this requires only external **bundler** nodes that direct back to the mainnet in the way it expects, this ERC already has a few popular implementations despite being closed.

This allows custom verification logic to be written in a deployed account-contract, and only a request made from an EOA, that the **entrypoint contract** calls. Since the EOA sends `UserOperation`s instead of **ETH Transactions**, and they send them to an **alternative mempool** instead of the **Ethereum mempool**, there is no gas involved.

This manages to diversify not only the verification logic which was original restricted to private-key cryptography, but also the individual involved in a transaction, since the account-contract needn't be deployed by the same individual that wants to transact. Additionally, the concept of a paymaster also diversifies whose pocket the transaction fee comes from.

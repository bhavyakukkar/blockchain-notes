# Proofs

## Zero Knowledge Proofs
- The proof-of-work in the classic Bitcoin blockchain is a key that when added to the hash of the block, yields a hash smaller than a specified amount (resulting in a hash with a certain number of leading 0 bits). However, this method requires the prover (miner) to provide the knowledge of an existing solution to the proof to the verifier (client).
- Zero-knowledge proofs are a family of proofs that attempt for the prover to prove to the verifier that they "could prove it if they wanted to"

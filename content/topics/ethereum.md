# Ethereum
- Ethereum came about as a way to generalize the nature in which the blockchain may be used, by conducting for the entries on the blockchain to be **"transaction-based state machine"**

- Ethereum recently switched to an alternative model to the proof-of-work model called `proof-of-stake`


## Smart Contracts
A stateful program that can be the recipient to decentralized transactions, where the parameters and results of the invoked program then get recorded into the blockchain.

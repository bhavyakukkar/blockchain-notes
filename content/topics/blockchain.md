# Blockchain
- Distributed (decentralized) and immutable (not modifiable) chain of blocks of signed transactions where each block is validated by special nodes that validate each transaction in the block against overspending and add their proof-of-work such that blocks can be trusted.
- Any implementation of Blockchain is a protocol that every client must agree on (since the blockchain is decentralized) and one that solves in any capacity the Byzantine Generals' Problem requiring a concensus to be reached among nodes across an unrealiable channel.
- Application layer protocol
